# Project Overview
This project involves the application of various data mining techniques to predict heart attack risks based on a given dataset. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the implementation of several machine learning models to achieve the best prediction accuracy.

## Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn
- statsmodels
- scipy

## Data Preprocessing
-**Reading the Dataset**: The dataset heart_attack_prediction_dataset.csv is read into a pandas DataFrame.
-**Initial Data Exploration**: Conducted initial exploration including checking data types, missing values, and statistical summaries.
-**Correlation Analysis**: Generated a heatmap to visualize the correlation between variables.

## Feature Engineering:
Converted the blood pressure column into categorical categories (High, Low, Normal) to improve the prediction accuracy.

## Machine Learning Models:
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Model Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- R-squared (RÂ²)
